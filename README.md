üîê Authentication System
The authentication system is designed with flexibility and extensibility in mind using key design patterns:

Strategy Pattern: Used to support multiple authentication methods, including traditional email/password login and social media login (e.g., Google). This allows adding new providers like Facebook without modifying the core authentication logic.

Factory Pattern: Responsible for returning the appropriate class instance based on the authentication method, enabling a clean and decoupled implementation.

Email Verification:

For traditional email sign-ups, users must verify their email address.

Email verification uses Laravel Events, Jobs, and Notifications to send a verification link asynchronously.

Users can also resend the verification email if needed.

Clean Architecture:

Authentication logic is abstracted using Repository and Service Layers, ensuring a separation of concerns and making the codebase easy to maintain and test.

This approach ensures the authentication module is scalable, testable, and ready for production use.



üõ†Ô∏è Admin Panel
The Admin Panel provides a comprehensive management interface allowing administrators to efficiently oversee key aspects of the application:

Category Management: Admins can create, update, delete, and organize product categories to keep the catalog structured and up-to-date.

Product Management: Full control over products, including adding new items, editing existing ones, and removing outdated or discontinued products.

Order Status Management: Ability to modify and track order statuses throughout the order lifecycle, ensuring smooth processing and accurate customer updates.

User Management: Admins can manage user accounts, including viewing, editing, and controlling access levels.

This section is designed to empower admins with all necessary tools for effective backend management, built with a focus on security, usability, and scalability.


üë§ User Features
The User module offers a seamless and intuitive experience for customers to interact with the platform:

Browse Categories and Products: Users can easily explore all available product categories and view detailed information about each product.

Profile Management: Users can view and update their profile information to keep their account details current.

Shopping Cart Management: Users can add products to the cart, update quantities, remove items, and review the cart contents before checkout.

Secure Payments: Supports payment processing through popular gateways such as PayPal and Stripe, ensuring a smooth and secure checkout experience.

This module focuses on usability and security, providing users with all the tools they need for effortless shopping and account management.


üí≥ Payment Gateways & Application Architecture
Payment Gateways Handling:
Payment processing is implemented using the Strategy and Factory design patterns. This approach provides flexibility to easily add or switch payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) in the future without modifying existing code.

Dependency Injection:
The entire application leverages Dependency Injection to promote loose coupling and enhance testability and maintainability.

Repository and Service Layers:
Business logic and data access are abstracted via Repository and Service layers, using interfaces to ensure clear contracts and facilitate easy swapping or mocking during testing.

This clean and modular architecture ensures the codebase remains scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend as the application grows.

‚öôÔ∏è Asynchronous Processing & Notifications
The application employs Laravel's powerful features for handling background tasks and user notifications efficiently:

Jobs & Queues:
Time-consuming tasks like sending emails or processing heavy operations are offloaded to background Jobs using Laravel's Queue system, improving app responsiveness and user experience.

Events & Listeners:
Business events trigger Events that are handled by Listeners to decouple different parts of the application and promote clean, maintainable code.

Notifications:
Users receive timely notifications via multiple channels (email, database, etc.) to keep them informed about important actions like email verification, order updates, and more.

This architecture ensures smooth, scalable, and user-friendly operations without blocking the main application flow.
