üîê Authentication System

The authentication system is designed with flexibility and extensibility in mind using key design patterns:

Strategy Pattern:Supports multiple authentication methods, including traditional email/password login and social media login (e.g., Google). This allows adding new providers like Facebook without modifying the core authentication logic.

Factory Pattern:Returns the appropriate class instance based on the authentication method, enabling a clean and decoupled implementation.

Email Verification

For traditional email sign-ups, users must verify their email address.

Email verification uses Laravel Events, Jobs, and Notifications to send a verification link asynchronously.

Users can also resend the verification email if needed.

Clean Architecture

Authentication logic is abstracted using Repository and Service Layers, ensuring separation of concerns and easy maintainability.

This approach ensures the authentication module is scalable, testable, and production-ready.

üõ†Ô∏è Admin Panel

The Admin Panel provides a comprehensive management interface allowing administrators to efficiently oversee key aspects of the application:

Category Management: Create, update, delete, and organize product categories.

Product Management: Add, edit, and remove products.

Order Status Management: Modify and track order statuses during the order lifecycle.

User Management: Manage user accounts and control access levels.

Admin Roles & Permissions: Manage administrators and assign roles securely.

Designed with a focus on security, usability, and scalability.

üë§ User Features

The User module offers a seamless and intuitive experience for customers:

Browse Categories and Products: Explore categories and detailed product info.

Profile Management: View and update user profile details.

Shopping Cart Management: Add, update, remove products, and review cart contents.

Secure Payments: Supports payments via PayPal and Stripe.

Focus on usability and security for effortless shopping.

üí≥ Application Architecture

Payment Gateways Handling:Implemented using Strategy and Factory patterns for easy addition or switching of gateways like PayPal and Stripe without changing existing code.

Dependency Injection:Used across the application to promote loose coupling, easier testing, and maintainability.

Repository and Service Layers:Abstract business logic and data access via interfaces, facilitating clean architecture and testability.

This ensures scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

‚öôÔ∏è Asynchronous Processing & Notifications

Jobs & Queues:Background tasks (e.g., sending emails) are handled asynchronously with Laravel Queues, improving responsiveness.

Events & Listeners:Business events trigger decoupled listeners for clean and maintainable code.

Notifications:Users receive notifications via email, database, and other channels for events like email verification and order updates.

This setup ensures smooth, scalable, and user-friendly operations.
